# Multi-TV Builder Power for Kiro

Use this Kiro power to build production-ready cross-platform TV applications with React Native - supporting Android TV, Apple TV, Fire TV (Fire OS & Vega OS), and Web TV platforms with a single codebase.

## What is This Power?

It combines monorepo architecture, shared UI components, platform-specific optimizations, and TV-optimized navigation into a unified development framework.

This power is designed for use with [Kiro](https://kiro.dev), more on [Kiro Powers](https://kiro.dev/docs/powers/)

## Installing the Power

### In Kiro

1. Open Kiro
2. Go to Powers panel
3. Click "Add power from Local Path" or "Add power from GitHub"
4. Select this directory or provide the repository URL


## Using the Power

Once installed, the power activates automatically when you mention TV development in your conversation with Kiro. You can also explicitly reference it:

- "Help me build a TV app with React Native"
- "How do I set up spatial navigation for Fire TV?"
- "What's the best way to structure a multi-TV app?"
- "Show me how to implement video playback for TV"
